title: Spring Equinox Unconference
subtitle: 20th March 2021

> #### Equinox
>
> The time when the Earth day is equally divided between night and day.

Spring Equinox summons us with an inviting warmth. At this significant point in time we synchronize to celebrate our place in life amidst natural forces which move the outer world as much as the inner. In the eternal search for balance we embrace paradox to leverage a potential inherent in our polarities. As light casts a shadow, so order breeds chaos. As the sun welcomes us, the night subsides. And, once more, the yin meets the yang.

> #### Unconference

> a participant-driven gathering to Learn, Teach and Share

Unconferences are loosely structured and coordinated by participants who abide by the law of two feet; if you fail to receive value, please seek a space where you are or better, create some! Our themes are open in ethos and non-prescribed, anyone can get involved in ways of their own choosing. This is a participatory meeting of hands, heads, and hearts in an open space to build collective capacity and common potential.

</br><strong class="prose lg:prose-xl"> We are practicing self-organisation where no-one and everyone is a facilitator. </br> Please self-facillitate and join us this Equinox in a game of artful participation! </strong>
