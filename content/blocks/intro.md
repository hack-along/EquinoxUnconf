title: Spring Equinox Unconference (second iteration)
subtitle: 20th March 2021

> #### Equinox

> The time when the Earth day is equally divided between night and day.

Spring Equinox summons us. At this significant point in time we synchronize and celebrate our place in life amidst natural forces which move the outer world as much as the inner. An eternal search for balance were we embrace paradox to leverage the potential in our polarities. As light casts a shadow, so order breeds chaos. As the sun welcomes us, the night subsides. And, once more, the yin meets the yang.

> a participant-driven gathering to Learn, Teach and Share

Unconferences are loosely structured and coordinated by participants who abide by the law of two feet; if you fail to receiving value, please find a space where you are or create some for others! Our themes are open in ethos and non-prescribed, anyone can get involved in ways of their own choosing. This is a participatory meeting of hands, heads, and hearts in an open space to build collective capacity and common potential.

</br><strong class="prose lg:prose-xl"> We are practicing self-organisation where no-one and everyone is a facilitator. </br> Please self-facillitate and join us this Equinox in a game of artful participation! </strong>
