> #### Equinox
>
> A time when the Earth day is equally divided between night and day.

At this significant point in time we synchronize to celebrate our place in life amidst the natural forces which move our outer world as much as our inner. In the eternal search for balance we embrace paradox to leverage a potential inherent in our polarities. As light casts a shadow, so order breeds chaos. As the sun welcomes us, the night subsides. And, once more, the yin meets the yang.

> #### Unconference
>
> a participant-driven gathering to Play, Learn, Teach, and Share

Unconferences are loosely structured and coordinated by participants who abide by the 'law of two feet'; go wherever you feel like going! If you feel lost, perhaps you might seek somebody. If you can't find a space, create one! Our themes are open in ethos and non-prescribed, anyone can get involved in ways of their own choosing. This is a participatory meeting of hands, heads, and hearts in an open space to build collective capacity, embrace diversity, and manifest our resonant potential. Play the way you feel it.

</br><strong class="prose lg:prose-xl"> We are practising self-organisation where no-one and everyone is a facilitator. </br> Please share in the richness and responsibility of *co-facilitating* and join us this Equinox in a game of artful participation! </strong>
