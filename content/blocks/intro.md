> #### Equinox
>
> time the Earth day is equally divided between night and day.

As Equinox summons us. We synchronize at this significant point in time to celebrate our place in life amidst the natural forces which move the outer world as much as the inner. Eternally we search for balance and embrace paradox to leverage the potential of polarity. As light casts a shadow, so order breeds chaos. As the sun welcomes us, the night subsides. And, once more, the yin meets the yang.

> #### Unconference
>
> a participant-driven gathering to Learn, Teach and Share

Unconferences are loosely structured and coordinated by participants who abide by the law of two feet - if your not receiving value, please find a space where you are or create some value for others! Our themes are open in ethos and non-prescribed, anyone can get involved in ways of their own choosing. This is a participatory meeting of hands, heads, and hearts in an open space to build collective capacity and common potential.

</br><strong class="prose lg:prose-xl"> We are practicing self-organisation where no-one and everyone is a facilitator. </br> Please join us this Equinox in a game of artful participation! </strong>
