#### Un-Programme

This track has no agenda; channel names change as "dynamic signals" calling your attention. Gather in small groups based on shared purpose and interest.

**Dynamic channel names:** Channels can easily be created in Discord for new conversations. As conversations drift and topics change, rename them by right-clicking and selecting "edit channel" to update them and let others know. This is a very easy way to signal what is going on in your little nook of the internet.

#### Purpose

- To create safe spaces for human connection and exploration
- Getting to know each other

#### Format guided by [open space principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)

- Whoever comes are the right people
- Whatever happens, is the only thing that could have
