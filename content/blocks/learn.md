#### Un-Programme

This track has no agenda; Channel names change as "dynamic signals" calling your attention. Gather in small groups based on shared purpose and interest.

**Dynamic channel names:** Channels can easily be created in Discord for new conversations. As conversations drift and topics change, rename them by right clicking and selecting "edit channel" to update them and let others know. This is a very easy way to signal whats going on in your little nook of the internet. 

#### Purpose

- To create a safe space for human connection.
- Getting to know each other,
- Meet old and new friends
- Spark curiosity

#### Format guided by [open space principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)

- Whoever comes are the right people
- Whatever happens, is the only thing that could have,
- When it starts it's the right time,
- When it’s over it’s over.
