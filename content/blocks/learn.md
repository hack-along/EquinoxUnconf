#### Un-Programme

This track has no agenda; Channel names are "dynamic signals" changing to call your attention. Gather in small groups based on shared interest.

Dynamic channel names: Channels can easily be created in Discord for new conversations. As conversations drift and topics change rename them by right clicking and selecting "edit channel". This is a very easy way to signal whats going on to others elsewhere in the digital space. 

#### Purpose

- To create a safe space for human connection.
- Getting to know each other,
- Meet old and new friends
- Spark curiosity

#### Format guided by [open space principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)

- Whoever comes are the right people
- Whatever happens, is the only thing that could have,
- When it starts it's the right time,
- When it’s over it’s over.

#### Themes

Themes are emergent.
