#### Un-Programme

For this event, there is no agenda. We come together based on shared purpose and guided by emergent principles.

#### Purpose

- To create a safe space for human connection.
- Getting to know each other,
- Meet old and new friends
- Spark curiosity

#### Format guided by [open space principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)

- Whoever comes is the right people
- Whatever happens, is the only thing that could have,
- When it starts is the right time,
- When it’s over it’s over.

#### Themes

Themes are emergent.
