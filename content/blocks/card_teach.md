Share an experience of open space with a diverse and interesting group who are co-creating and organising our selves around some intractable sensation of shared interest.

Feel welcome to interact during informal sessions and contribute to each other's journey by sharing stories, ideas, experiences or whatever together. Otherwise, simply jump in and start your own session. All kinds of contributions are welcome.
