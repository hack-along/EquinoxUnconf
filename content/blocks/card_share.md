Grab a spade and come community gardening; your help is most welcome!
Volunteering to share your intentions and attention is much appreciated. We've also thought of a variety of ways that the uninitiated may contribute.

In that spirit, please feel welcome to drop in to a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/j9vp5x6Whq) if you're up for planting a few holes with us! Exercise your judgment and please invite kin whom you feel would contribute generatively to our shared experiences.
