ðŸŒ• **_ Where is the Equinox Unconference happening?_**
It will happen on [Discord](https://discord.gg/j9vp5x6Whq). New to Discord? Find out more about it [here](https://discord.com/).

ðŸŒ• **_ How to join Discord?_**
This magic link will take you straight to a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/kevFecu8an). Don't get confused by the name, as everyone is an admin, it can be changed by anyone, anytime!

ðŸŒ• **_ Where are the rooms?_**
The rooms are on the left-hand side under the 'Equinox' category heading. You will see an icon of a loudspeaker next to the channel name if it's a voice channel with active participant avatars the name (if there's anyone in the room).

ðŸŒ• **_ We are having a parallel event on our own server, can we also join the Unconference?_**
Sure! You just need install the [disconference](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=869907283663020052&permissions=37310145&scope=bot) bot in your server.
Your programme, voice channels and participation will appear together with the other communities! If you wish you can also use that information to create your own map and programme on your website, by accessing the information at disconference.hackalong.io
