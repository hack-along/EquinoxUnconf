1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have it: `npm install --global @gridsome/cli`
2. Clone the repo: `git@github.com:hack-along/EquinoxUnconf.git`
3. `cd EquinoxUnconf`
4. `npm install`
5. run `gridsome develop` or `npm run dev` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
6. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

Note - if simply editing text content, it's enough to follow step 2 and edit. Bad practice though *tsk* *tsk*

# Events

There are two ways you can change or add events to the Unconference repo.
First one is by adding makdown (`.md`) files to [Content / Events directory](https://github.com/hack-along/EquinoxUnconf/blob/master/content/events/) or by going to [Netlify CMS admin pannel](https://unconference.hackalong.io/admin).

### Adding Events via Github

To add an event create a .md file in the [content/events directory](https://github.com/hack-along/EquinoxUnconf/blob/master/content/events/).

Use this **front matter** syntax to add any aditonal info before your main content. All of this is optional, but title is strongly recomended. NOTE: this is the human friendly syntax, files generated by NetlifyCMS can be different. If you would like to upload an image, please put it in the uploads/events directory.

### Adding Events via NetlifyCMS

Just go to [Netlify CMS admin pannel](https://unconference.hackalong.io/admin) and authorize the github/netlify connection.
From there on you can access the CMS and add or edit your own events. The markdown generated will look slightly different.

### Adding Vue components to markdown content

Events _(content/events/event.md)_ & Pages _(content/pages/page.md)_ are set-up using [Vue-Remakr](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/vue-remark) plug-in.

This plug-in not only translates markdown into html, it also allows you to **use Vue components directly in the markdown file**.

Have fun!
